For example:\n\n* What type of work is being done? (e.g., road construction, utility repair, filming)\n* What are the potential hazards? (e.g., traffic, falling objects, excavation)\n* What is the location? (This helps determine specific local regulations and potential environmental hazards.)\n* What are the workers wearing for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)?\n* What safety measures are in place? (e.g., traffic control, barricades, warning signs)"
